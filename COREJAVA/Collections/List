========
Here dupicates are allowed.
Insertion order is preserved.
Index play very important in List.

1. boolean add(int index,Object o);
2. boolean addAll(int index, Collection c);
3. Object get(int index);
4. Object remove(int index);
5. Object set(int index,Object o);
6. int indexOf(Object o);-> return first occurance of 'o'.

ArrayList
==========
it implements List interface.

It represent group of individual object in single entity where duplicate are allowed and insertion order preserved.
Null insertion possible.
Heterogeneous objects allowed.
Implements serializable and clonable interface.To provide support for hold and transfer objects from one tire to another tire.
Implements RandomAcess interface.
For retrival of random element it is best choice.

1. Arraylist al=new ArrayList();
Create a empty arrayList object with intial default capacity 10. When it reaches its maximum capacity it increases its size by 
New Capacity = (currentCapacity*3/2)+1.

2. ArrayList al=new ArrayList(Int intialcapacity);
Creates empty arraylist object with intial capacity specified in the parameter.

3. ArrayList al=new ArrayList(Collection c);
Creates equivalent arraylist object for given collection.It is used for inter conversation between collection objects.
