ARRAYS
=======
1.Arrays are fixed in size.
2.It is indexed based collection.
3.Contains only homogeneous data.
Student[] s=new Student[1000];
s[0]=new Student(); (Correct)
s[1]=new Customer();(Incorrect)
4.We can represent huge number of data elements in a single variable.
Limitations
===========
1.Fixed in size,can't extends it size. for that we have to create a new array and copy the old element to the new array.
2.Doesn't provide any ready made method support like other data structure(Collections).

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARRAYS AND COLLECTIONs
-----------------------------------------
ARRAYS
------
1.Arrays are fixed in size.(Cant't increase size )
2.Doesn't implemented based on some standard data structure so it doesn't provide ready made method support like collctions.
3.Memory point of view arrays are not recommended to use.
4.Performance point of view recommended to use.
5.It hold only homogeneous data element.
6.It contains both Object type and primitive type.

COLLECTION
-----------
1.Collection are growable in nature.
2.Implemented based on some standard data structure ,it provides ready made method support to perform operations.
3.Memory point of view Collection are recommended to use.
4.Performance point of view not recommended to use.
5.It holds both homogeneous and heterogeneous data element.
6.It contains only Object type data.
